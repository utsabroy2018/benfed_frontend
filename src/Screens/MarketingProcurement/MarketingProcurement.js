    <h1>Marketing Procurement</h1>

    {/* <p>The marketing division   of BENFED is mainly engaged in procurement of paddy from different   farmers of the state of West Bengal through various societies enlisted   with BENFED. This mechanism is performed under MSP (Minimum Support   Price) of the Government of India. MSP is a form of market intervention   by the Government of India to insure agricultural producers against any   sharp fall in farm prices. The MSP are announced at the beginning of the   sowing season of certain crops in the basis of the recommendations of   the Commission of Agricultural Costs and Prices (CACP). It thus helps   the producers/farmers against excessive fall in price during high   production years, the major objective being to support the farmers from   distress sales. The department is also engaged in procurement of other   agricultural produce like pulses, vegetables(mainly potato), grains,   spices etc. by ensuring support price to the respective farmers and also   by selling at market price in the open market or by supplying them to   the Government agencies. Under KMS (2015-16) more than 2 lakh farmers   are benefited through the help of BENFED. The primary focus of the   marketing team is to provide remunerative price to the farmers and   supply to the consumers at moderate rate.</p>
